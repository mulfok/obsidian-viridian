# 🖊️ Highlighters
Viridian offers the use of up to **eight** different highlighter colours for use across your notes. They're based off of standard Markdown, so all styling is applied on top of pre-existing systems.

You format your highlights the following way, and the standard colours are as such:

```
==One==             -> Yellow
_==Two==_           -> Red
__==Three==__       -> Pink
___==Four==___      -> Cyan
==`Five`==          -> Blue
_==`Six`==_         -> Purple
__==`Seven`==__     -> Lime
___==`Eight`==___   -> Green
```

> 💡 **Quick Tip**  
> Typing this can be quite cumbersome, so I suggest installing the useful [Wrap With Shortcuts](https://github.com/manic/obsidian-wrap-with-shortcuts) plugin, and setting hotkeys for the various highlight tags. I have mine set to _CTRL + 1-8._

If you have your own highlighter colours, you can adjust them for Light/Dark mode within Style Settings.
